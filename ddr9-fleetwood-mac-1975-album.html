Вдвоём со старшим братом заездили два винила до дыр. Гитары.

I know this sub mostly focuses on new pop music but I was wondering what songs, albums and artists people like from the 70's. These are my favorite songs; Donna Summer - I Feel Love (https://youtu.be/Nm-ISatLDG0) This song is quintessential disco imo. Donna always made great dance music The Carpenters - Superstar (https://youtu.be/SJmmaIGiGBg) Karen's voice is so beautiful and lush. It's a shame that she met such a sad demise. This is my personal favourite Carpenters song Remember. Интернет-магазин Более 24 000 альбомов на lp и cd можно купить через сайт. This has been running through my head as of late. A couple years ago I discovered Fleetwood Mac's earlier albums, pre-1975. I have always felt like I'm in the minority, but I definitely prefer their music before Stevie Nicks joined. Nothing against her personally, I just think their sound changed so much, from something really dynamic and bluesy, to more pop-y rock amp roll. Just was curious what a discussion about them would bring--what do you think? Early Fleetwood Mac, or commerically succe. Popular Posts.

( There's so many coincidences (spoilers for those that haven't seen Phantasm): -tall man in a suit -small man -little ball that is floating in the air -doorway I also get church-y vibes, which isn't directly related to the film, but is in a way because of the funeral home.

In this streaming era we live in, we always complain about the length of the albums or messy rollouts. and yet, there's an element of the promotion that gets sidetracked in the conversations: the art of single releases. And no, I don't mean like music videos or traditional promotion, which still exists, but rather the advantages of PHYSICAL single releases. Of course I don't expect than in this times of diminishing sales for an artist to release a CD/cassette/vinyl of every single promotional. Just wondering what everyone’s top 5 albums of all time are! Mine are 1: Fleetwood Mac - Rumours 2: Nwa - straight outta Compton 3 bob Marley - legend 4: the Beatles - abbey road 5: 1975 - i like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware ###Pop Essentials 3.0: The Poptimist's Playbook Welcome to my Pop Essential Albums List 3.0, my third attempt at curating the uncuratable: a definitive list of the most important, most influential, and most high quality pop music albums from the 1950s until the modern era.

I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by. For this purpose I started r/MBTIRadioStation so that there's a place to discuss Music + Psychology + MBTI. I think musicians and artists explore a lot of their psyche and shadow through their art. Art is the greatest healer ! To understand the music r/INFJ likes and loves, I searched for "music" on the searchbar and pulled out some of the songs you peeps have posted here.
